## Important note about this repository

The notebooks of this repository are  based on the [original work](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/use-original-data-for-cv-boost-and-lb-boost/notebook) by [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) on the [Backpack Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2).
I've added explanatory comments and analysis to better understand the approach of leveraging original data to improve predictions on synthetic competition data.

This repository is for educational purposes and documents my learning process in understanding advanced feature engineering techniques.
